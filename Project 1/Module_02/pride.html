    <p class="it">It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>

    <p class="my">“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”</p>
    <p class="mr">Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

    <p class="mr2">Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
